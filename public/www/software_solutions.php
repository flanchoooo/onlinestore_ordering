					<h1>Health Care Payment and Remittance Advice Electronic Billing system (Switching) - Medical clearing house</h1>	

					<p>We are in the process of building a switch to offer this unique service, the automated Electronic Remittance Advice system, which supplies medical scheme remittances electronically. This allows pharmacies/practitioners to reconcile their medical scheme claims within seconds!<p>
                     
                    <p>Electronic remittance advice helps save time by automatically posting insurance payments based on electronic reports delivered to practices. Users can receive electronic remittance advice (ERA) reports, receive a receipt of an electronic funds transfer (EFT), and use electronic remittance advice reports to automatically post insurance payments and reconcile balances. By receiving electronic payments and automating the payment posting process, medical institutions get paid faster and save time </p>
