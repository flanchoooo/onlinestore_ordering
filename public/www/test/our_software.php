                  <h3 class="hs">Complienz</h3>

				    <p style="margin-top:10px">Dispensing medication requires a decision support system that will enable the pharmacist to accurately determine the optimum medicinal regiment that best suits a patient based on an honest and up to date medical profile. Complienz is that decision support system.</p>

					<p style="margin-top:10px">The pharmaceutical industry is constantly and rapidly evolving creating a daunting task for medical professionals to remain as knowledgeable as they are expected to be. The Complienz drug interaction software that is integrated with the RxWin dispensing software enables the pharmacist to access valuable information allowing accurate prescriptions to be issued. Information that cannot be printed on the label due to its size such as drug-to-food directions and other vital counselling information can be printed on a separate page for the patient. This add-on service is extremely important as it falls in line with the new Consumer Protection Act.</p>

					<p style="margin-top:10px">Drug-to-drug, drug-to-food, drug-to-disease interactions due to the Cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes are all found in Complienz. The Complienz interaction software is so intricate it can flag genetic polymorphisms in different races as well as individual patients. Above all, the highlight of Complienz is the solution finding capability it has for drug-to-drug interactions.</p>

					<p style="margin-top:10px">“Medicines”, wrote Leonardo da Vinci, “will be well used when we understand their nature, what man is, what life is, and what constitution and health are. Know these well and you will know their opposites; you will then know well how to devise a remedy.”</p>
